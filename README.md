# gto_integrals_f90
This project aimed to perform gaussian type orbital (GTO) integrals to avoid numerical integrations. This source code is written principally in Fortran90 and reads some NRLMOL input to achieve GTO integrals for overlap, kinetic, two-electron, and four-electron integrals. This work was inspired by James John's videos series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb4fFQJ8bYw&ab_channel=JamesJohns) for the background and Josua (https://joshuagoings.com/2017/04/28/integrals/) for the McMurchie-Davidson recursive scheme.
